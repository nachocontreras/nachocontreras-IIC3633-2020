Ideas centrales para el mini resumen
- This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research eorts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive
summary of the state-of-the-art.
- However, there is a lack of extensive review on deep learning based recommender system. The goal of this survey is to thoroughly review literature on the advances of deep learning based recommender system
- Neural architectures have demonstrated tremendous success in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Dentro de estas se mencionan algunas con su explicación.
- recapitulate, we summarize the strengths of deep learning based recommendation models that readers might bear in mind when try to employ them for practice use (ver ejemplos de esa frase)
- Limitaciones (ver ejemplos)

Puntos interesantes
- In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research elds such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also the aractive property of learning feature representations from scratch.
- Deep learning is able to eectively capture the non-linear and non-trivial user-item relationships, and enable the codification of more complex abstractions as data representations in the higher layers
- of the most atractive properties of neural architectures is that they are (1) end-to-end dierentiable and (2) provide suitable inductive biases catered to the input data type.
- Tipos de deep leraning, con bloques neuronales e híbrido
- Tambien estan los multilayer perceptron, recomendaciones basadas en eso.
- there exist two general ways of applying autoencoder to recommender system: (1) using autoencoder to learn lower-dimensional feature representations at the boleneck layer; or (2) lling the blanks of the interaction matrix directly in the reconstruction layer
- Convolution Neural Networks are powerful in processing unstructured multimedia data with convolution and pool operations. Most of the CNNs based recommendation models utilize CNNs for feature extraction.
